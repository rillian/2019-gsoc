# CDLI supports Canonical Text Services
---

The Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative participated in Google's
*Summer of Code* program this year, which pairs students with
open source programming projects.

One of the projects was to make cuneiform transcriptions and
translations from its the extensive database available in
TEI-XML laid out in the file hierarchy described by the
[*Canonical Text Services*](https://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-doc/cite/texts/ctsoverview.html) model used by digital humanities
projects working with texts from the ancient world.

This makes a broad set of tools developed for analysis of
historical texts available to Assyriologists.
The CTS standard is the basis for the new [Scaife reading
environment](https://scaife.perseus.org/) developed for the Perseus Open Greek and Latin project,
which provides easy and intuitive access to the corpus
for reading, cross-reference, and comparison.

CDLI publishes under an open data model. By supporting common
formats, we can make use of common tools across multiple scholarly
communities, allowing scholars and students to access and build on
the data in new ways. A new
[export repository](https://github.com/cdli-gh/cdli-cts/)
is available with a subset of the complete corpus for any researchers
who want to try it out.

In the future we hope to further develop this reader to allow for
inter-linear translations, include metadata from the object catalog,
and link to tablet images (when available). The Scaife project
represents the valuable investment and cooperation in open-source
technologies for the study of the ancient world. We're excited
to be working with our colleagues in the Greco-Roman classics
to facilitate the dissemination of ancient texts.

CDLI was one of 204 organizations awarded participation in this
year's Summer of Code program. Five students were selected and
participated with the project this year.
